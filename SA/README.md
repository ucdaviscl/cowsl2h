# COWS-L2H-SA
## Corpus of Written Spanish- L2 and Heritage- Study Abroad

This is the subset of the COWS corpus consisting of data from immersive study abroad (SA) programs in Spanish-speaking contexts.

The dataset currently contains data from two programs led by a large, US university in two locations: Mendoza, Argentina (in 2022) and Madrid, Spain (2023). Data from the 2023 iteration of the Mendoza program is expected to be added early in 2024.

### About the data

The prompts were designed as emails that students had to write to make requests from two types of interlocutors that differ in social distance:

1. An older professor from the host country (greater social distance)
2. A peer (someone around their age) from the host country (less social distance)

The students were asked to write 200-250 words per email if they were at the intermediate or advanced level, and at least 50 words per email if they were at the beginner level. They were instructed to make the emails as realistic as possible and to not use outside resources.

The programs are 10-11 weeks in length. Data was collected on the following interval, although not all participants completed all of the tasks:


| Time        | Description | Prompt     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Time 1      | Beginning of SA program       | Ask for information about something    |
| Time 2   | Middle of SA program        | Ask for a favor        |
| Time 3   | End of SA program        | Request something        |
| Time 4   | 2.5 months after SA program        | Ask for advice about something        |
| Time 5   | 5 months after SA program        | Request information        |
| Time 6   | 7.5 months after SA program        | Ask for feedback about something        |
| Time 7   | 1 year since beginning of SA program        | Ask for information about something (repeat of first prompt)        |
