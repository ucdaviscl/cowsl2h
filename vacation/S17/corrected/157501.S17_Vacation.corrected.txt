For my perfect vacation, I would love to return to my hometown, Oaxaca, Mexico. I grew up in a small, rural town in Oaxaca. I have always dreamt of returning and spending time with the people I grew up and miss a lot. Oaxaca is a beautiful state. It is rich in culture, nature, and beauty. I will start my vacation on the town I grew up. I will visit my grandmother and my childhood friends. Then, I would visit a town commonly called "Las Nievitas". In Las Nievitas, exchange of goods such as food takes place between indigenous and Mexican people. Indigenous speak their native language, which most visitants do not speak. It's a pretty interesting and fun exchange. Then, I would visit the beaches. Oaxaca has the most beautiful beaches. I will visit Huatulco. It is a beach known for its natural beauty and delicious food. I will continue my trip in Juquila, Oaxaca. It is a very known town for its saint "La virgen de Juquila". As a child, I promised I would return once I finished my academic career. I would love for my best friend, Eh They, to accompany me, that would make this the perfect vacation. Eh They is Karen, from Thailand. I have known her for eight years. I will also love to continue my trip in Thailand. This way, she would love get to know my culture and I would get to know her. Similarly as me, Eh They also grew up in Thailand until she was 12 years old. Returning to our homeland together will be an awesome and perfect experience.
