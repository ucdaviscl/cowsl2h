# COWS-L2H-SA
## Corpus of Written Spanish- L2 and Heritage- Study Abroad

This is the subset of the COWS corpus consisting of data from immersive study abroad (SA) programs in Spanish-speaking contexts.

The dataset currently contains data from two programs led by US universities in two locations: Mendoza, Argentina (in 2022) and Madrid, Spain (2023). Data from the 2023 iteration of the Mendoza program is expected to be added early in 2024.

The programs are 10-11 weeks in length. Data was collected on the following interval:

**1. Time 1:** Beginning of SA program [not available for Mendoza 2022]

**2. Time 2:** Middle of SA program

**3. Time 3:** End of SA program

[Delayed post-test data]

**4. Time 4:** 2.5 months after SA program

**5. Time 5:** 5 months after SA program

**6. Time 6:** 7.5 months after SA program

**7. Time 7:** 10 months after SA program

**8. Time 8:** 12 months after SA program
