Once upon a time, hay una princesa. Tiene []{el}<ab:det:art:def> pelo moreno y []{los}<ab:det:art:def> ojos [azul]{azules}<na:adj>. Se gustas leer y caminar an la parque. Se gustas nadar y jugar con su amigos. No me gusta beber jugo de tomate porque she thought it was que asco. Uno dia, she was caminando por el bosque cuando ves un bear. She was not asustada. Instead she was [contento]{contenta}<ga:adj> porque el bear was simpatico. When the bear saw her, he smiled. She smiled back and walked towards him.  En el momento their ojos locked, they fell en encanta.  "Hola!"  "Hola!"  "Come te illamas?"  "Me illamo es *FIRST_NAME*. Y tu?"  "Me illamo es *FIRST_NAME*"  "Donde vas *FIRST_NAME*?"  "Voy a caminar en el parque. Do you want to join me?"  "Si!"  They walked  together, hand in hand, and cuando they reached el parque, *FIRST_NAME* was nowhere to be found. *FIRST_NAME* looked around but couldn't find him. Then she heard a growl, pero it wasn't because *FIRST_NAME* was about to comer her. He was  transforming. She looked at him in awe.  He turned into a princeso.  "Soy *FIRST_NAME*, Princeso de []{el}<ab:det:art:def> bosque. Will you marry me *FIRST_NAME*?"  "No, but I will date you, and then we can see about the marriage thing."  "Perfecto!"  And they lived happily ever after. :)
