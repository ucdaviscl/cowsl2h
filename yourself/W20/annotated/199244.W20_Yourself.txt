I am a *AGE* year old student majoring in electrical engineering. Both of my parents are from *PLACE* but I was born here in the U.S.. Spanish is my primary way of communicating with my parents at home but with friends and siblings I speak english. Growing up I was placed in only spanish speaking student classes all the way up to the third grade. I learned english and spanish at the same time but english became my primary language by the end of 4th grade. In the 5th grade I had to take an english language development class which I don't really remember much about. I learned spanish from school and my parents. I began learning english pretty early on  from music, video games, and friends (as well as some school work).  My siblings and I, are all on a different level when in comes to spanish. There was a lot of re-form that went into my school throughout our age gaps. Most of the changes were in the elementary school and by  the time my youngest brother was in school, they no longer separated students by whether they speak spanish or not. I am the second youngest in my family, I have a younger brother, an older sister, and an eldest brother. I believe that I know the most spanish out of all my siblings because I took two spanish courses in high school and passed an AP Spanish test for a third class I didn't take. Recently my spanish has been affected and I tend to speak more slang and vulgar spanish since I worked for about three years in construction and field work. I am currently taking spanish 23 to help work on re-learning a more formal spanish.
