Hola, yo me llamo *FIRST_NAME*. Tengo *AGE* *AGE* anos. Mi familia es de *CITY* *CITY* *CITY* en *PLACE*. Pero yo nací en los Estados Unidos. Crecí en una casa bilingüe, pero desafortunadamente creciendo, el español se usó menos. Siempre había crecido deseando aprender a escribir en español. Intenté duolingo, pero no me gusto. I took up french in High school, because I grew up in *STATE* where it is used a lot! It is nice knowing 3 languages, but I soon realized I had to become fluent in Spanish. I speak to my family from time to time from Mexico on Facebook. I can read it better than write it!  I was embaressed to answer at times, because I knew I was not spelling things correctly. So when I came to *UNIVERSITY* *UNIVERSITY* I took up the opportunity to take a spanish class in the Spring. I loved it! The professor was very patient and nice. I felt more confident in communicating with my family.  So this fall I decided to take it up once again.
