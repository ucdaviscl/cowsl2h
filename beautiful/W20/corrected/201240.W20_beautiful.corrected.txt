Once upon a time, hay una princesa. Tiene el pelo moreno y los ojos azules. Le gusta leer y caminar por la parque. Le gusta nadar y jugar con su amigos. No le gusta beber jugo de tomate porque she thought it was que asco. Un día, she was caminando por el bosque cuando vio un bear. She was not asustada. Instead she was contenta porque el bear was simpatico. When the bear saw her, he smiled. She smiled back and walked towards him.  En el momento their ojos locked, they fell en encanta.  "¡Hola!"  "¡Hola!"  "¿Cómo te llamas?"  "Me llamo es *FIRST_NAME*. ¿Y tú?"  "Me llamo es *FIRST_NAME*."  "¿A dónde vas, *FIRST_NAME*?"  "Voy a caminar por el parque. Do you want to join me?"  "¡Sí!"  They walked together, hand in hand, and cuando they reached el parque, *FIRST_NAME* was nowhere to be found. *FIRST_NAME* looked around but couldn't find him. Then she heard a growl, pero it wasn't because *FIRST_NAME* was about to comer her. He was transforming. She looked at him in awe.  He turned into a príncipe.  "Soy *FIRST_NAME*, príncipe del bosque. Will you marry me *FIRST_NAME*?"  "No, but I will date you, and then we can see about the marriage thing."  "¡Perfecto!"  And they lived happily ever after. :)
